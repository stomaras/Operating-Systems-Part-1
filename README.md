# Operating-Systems-Part-1

# 1)Introduction to Computer Systems 
Before seeing what an os is ...let's first see what is meant by a Computer System ...Ok?

Combination of hardware,softwareand data which are used to solve the problem of human beings

See as a user ,we want to solve our problems...OK?

For example i wanted to access a webpage
            i want to access a photo
            
We use Computer System ,I meant we use hardware devices some software devices...software is nothing but programs

Let's assume we want to edit a photograph
    problem: To solve this problem we use hardware .Hardware means we use hardware devices in our computer Right?
    
Most important part in our computer is CPU 
CPU = Central Process Unit
CPU = small chip
Now what this chip will do is ... it will fetch the programms 
Programm = Software

Programs will stored inside the RAM or Memory 
Now what CPU will do is ...it will fetch the programm from the memory
and then it will execute it

Anything you do,CPU needs to execute an instruction = part of program
instruction = line of program
Collection of instructions is a Program

Hardware-> CPU, Memory

We have various types of memory in our computer
1)RAM
2)Hard Disk
3)Cache
4)Registers

We store the program inside the memory .The CPU or chip will take the program line by line or instruction by instruction and then 
will execute it 

Any Software in our computer has a program at the backend 

For Example if you are using MS-WORD .now Microsoft should have written a programm for MS-WORD and that program will be stored inside 
your Hard Disk and for execution the program will be moved from Hard Disk to RAM
Then CPU will fetch the programm line by line that program written by Microsoft 
Why we move the programm from Hard Disk to RAM is different we will discuss later...

Every Program that cpu want to execute need to present inside the RAM

Now a part from program will be something called data 
For example to edit a photograph with photoshop you need data which are photos
Data = any raw data for example you take images video file audio file text file

Now one question you may ask is why are we using these many levels of memory?

We are using these many levels of memory because ...every memory system has its own advantages as well as disadvantages

CACHE and REGISTERS in case of computer organization and Architecture ok?
  This is not very important to operating systems in order to understand os
  
 DIFFERENCE between RAM and HARD DISK:
 RAM                  HARD DISK
 1)Not permanent      1)Whatever is stored is Permanent 
 2)Faster than HD     2)Slow speed compare to RAM
 
 The more bigger the ram is the more faster your computer will be ok?
 you will understand it into multiprogramming concept
 
 Either it is a program or data will be present inside the HARD DISK
 
 Now the biggest problem is the time taken by the CPU to access the data
 very long time 
 
 Disadvantage of HARD DISK is that we move data to ram 
 
 Data is actually copy and paste into the RAM ...it is not cut-paste
 A copy of this will be created and moved into RAM
 Which means this will be present both in RAM as well as in Hard Disk 
 With this way we are able to have our Data permanently inside the Hard Disk and access fast from RAM
